///    lyrics never look again; neither do the user's own text and the

///    that it has none - is kept per song in the lyrics cache
///    ([_fromProvider]) and used from then on, across restarts, until the
///    user clears the lyrics cache ([clearAll]). Only a request that didn't
///    get through (timeout, rate limit) is asked again, on a later run.
///
/// The song's chosen lyrics are saved in song.lyrics and the cache file.
